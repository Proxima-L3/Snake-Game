<h2>Goals/purposes:</h2>
Get more experience learning frameworks, learn how to use Pygame, create a game that actually has a gui, practice 
resourcefulness/learning "on the fly" (determine and find required information in order to implement a feature 
instead of using videos and/or going through an entire online course before actually creating something), practice 
using pep8 and improving the structure of my code, learn about event handling, practice using/creating modules/packages 
in python, practice using classes and all their features to gain a better understanding of OOP and why you'd want to 
use it in the first place (one of the main purposes of this project), exercise the practice of making readme files, 
learn how to use file I/O reading/writing, learn how to use adobe xd to make mockups, learn about licensing and how to 
find and use external assets, learn how to modify and create assets in adobe photoshop and illustrator, exercise the 
practice of refactoring code, practice using type annotations, learn about docstring formats, use inline comments, use 
inline conditionals, use list comprehensions, learn about and use map/filter and lambda expressions, gain understanding 
of positional and keyword arguments, get better at planning and organizing projects via txt outlines and scrum 
(see note below), and practice using git/github (honestly should've connected this project to a repo 
from the very beginning instead of after it was finished; silver lining: I definitely understand how useful and 
necessary version control software is now).

<h3>Note:</h3>

- The project folder named "project_plans_scrum_files" holds "bricks_in_the_wall.txt". It started out as a file used 
for breaking down abstract features into implementation steps and to also keep track of difficult challenges that I 
overcame throughout my project, so that I could encourage myself to persist. The file, "features.txt" was made to keep 
track of features that I wanted to eventually implement. Both of these files, however, slowly morphed into what I 
realized was a kind of scrum board. The line under the WIP section that says "_wip-loc_", is just a way to indicate to 
myself where the current task "location" was. (Also, the "algorithms.txt" file was supposed to be used to create 
algorithms and sample runs for features that I wanted to implement, but I ended up just using my notebook and 
"bricks_in_the_wall.txt" to create my project's solutions/algorithms. As a result, "algorithms.txt" never really 
advanced into something more coherent).
